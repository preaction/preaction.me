# Add Yancy

Yancy helps us manage the content on our site. We can use Yancy to
easily add new To-do items to our site.

To add Yancy, all we need to do is hand it our database and tell it to
read our schema to build its forms. Yancy can generate its configuration
from our database schema and give us a rich form to edit our data.

XXX Go into how to configure Yancy to make the forms better

XXX Mention mojo_migrations and then configure it to be removed from the list

XXX Skip this blog by inserting items directly in the database. We'll add
a user form for this later.
