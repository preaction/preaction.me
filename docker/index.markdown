# Docker - Application Containers

[Docker](http://docker.com) is an [application
container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_%28virtualization%29)
that allows isolating your program from its host operating system. This,
in turn, eases deployment by requiring your program to bundle with all
of the dependencies it needs to run (including basic system libraries).

This talk introduces Docker, explains a little bit about how it works,
and walks through some simple usage scenarios including single-container
Docker and multiple-container applications with [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
