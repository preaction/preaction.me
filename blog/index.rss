                <p>A <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/PREACTION/Log-Any-1.044-TRIAL">new trial of Log::Any (1.044) has been
released</a>.
This release has a couple changes that make Log::Any a bit more
predictable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passing in objects to formatted log methods now handles objects that
overload stringify correctly. Previously, these objects would be given
to Data::Dumper, which violates object encapsulation. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/mephinet">Philipp
Gortan (@mephinet)</a>!</li>
<li>The imported Log::Any object (<code>use Log::Any &#39;$log&#39;</code>) can now be named
anything (like <code>$LOG</code> or <code>$foo</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since <a href="http://www.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers</a> is still catching up
<a href="http://blog.cpantesters.org/diary/203">from its little bit of downtime a few weeks
ago</a>, I won&#39;t be releasing this
as stable until I get some success reports in. So, you&#39;ve got some time
to test this against your own codebase if you need to.  Please <a href="http://github.com/preaction/Log-Any/issues">report
any issues to the Log-Any Github
repository</a>.</p>

release</a>,
I&#39;ve pushed a <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/PREACTION/Log-Any-1.042">new standard release of Log::Any 1.042 to

                <p>I&#39;ve just released a new <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Any">Log::Any</a>
trial release. This release improves performance immensely when there
are no log output adapters configured. This release also now returns the
formatted log string from logging methods, allowing the log message to
be used by a <code>die</code> or <code>warn</code> call.</p>

<p>Because of these changes, there is a very small chance of an
incompatibility: Log::Any logging methods used to return whatever the
configured adapter returned (this was undocumented and was not
a feature). Now they always return the formatted log message.</p>

<p>So if you depend on Log::Any, please give
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PR/PREACTION/Log-Any-1.041-TRIAL.tar.gz">Log-Any-1.041-TRIAL</a>
a test run through and report any issues to <a href="http://github.com/preaction/Log-Any/issues">the Log-Any Github
tracker</a>.</p>

<p>I’d love to see the list of new food at the Wisconsin State Fair, but
there’s a big purple bar in the way. With the always-there header taking
up 1/3 of my browser height, I have barely two inches of space to read
the content that is supposed to make me want to go to the fair...</p>

<p>Seen at <a href="http://wistatefair.com/fair/Food-Category/new-foods/">http://wistatefair.com/fair/Food-Category/new-foods/</a></p>

            <title>What History Class Did You Fail?</title>
            <link>http://preaction.me/blog/2016/07/08/what-history-class-did-you-fail-/</link>
            <guid>http://preaction.me/blog/2016/07/08/what-history-class-did-you-fail-/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Every time I’m involved in some social media discussion, I hear so much
completely inaccurate information being repeated time and again. Today,
someone claimed that people in South Africa would have “Black
Privilege”, completely ignorant of the long history of violent white
supremacy that ended less than 30 years ago. Additionally, way too many
people are ignorant of Jim Crow, and all the things that led up to and
followed the 1960’s Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>Ignoring the history of race relations is the foundation of a generation
of future racists. This complete ignorance of the past, this
white-washing, this idea that “racism ended in 1964 with the Civil
Rights Act”, these ideas are the start of a belief that the current race
relation problem is “reverse racism”: White people being discriminated
against. And since anti-Black racism is “over”, all the crime statistics
that show problems disproportionately affecting Black people must mean
that Black people are “just naturally like that.”</p>

<p>Curiously, these people are always well-“informed” about the history of
slavery world-wide, but never about how the Americas changed all that,
too. Indentured servitude is not chattel slavery, but the distinction is
both lost and meaningless to those who want to believe that global
racism ended with the abolition of slavery in the US. And again, the
bleaching of history: The Civil War was about state’s rights, despite
the libraries of information written at the time on the topic about the
war’s aims.</p>

<p>It has taken me mere months of casual perusal to learn the things that
I know, or, more accurately, probe the vastness of the chasm that is my
ignorance. With all the current news about racial violence, what hope
for change can there be if we aren’t all putting in this minimum amount
of effort to understand our fellow humans?</p>
