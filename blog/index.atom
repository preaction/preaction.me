        <title>A Community is a Reflection of its Leaders</title>
        <link href="http://preaction.me/blog/2016/01/15/a-community-is-a-reflection-of-its-leaders/" rel="alternate" />
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
            <p>I&#39;ve been in charge of <a href="http://preaction.me/blog/2016/01/15/a-community-is-a-reflection-of-its-leaders/#footnote-1">a certain community</a> for a very
long time. Before my actual tech career started, even. Back when doing
websites was just a hobby I didn&#39;t want to ruin by getting money
involved.</p>

<p>I was put in charge of this community after only a few hours of effort:
I wanted to learn something, I saw that a community didn&#39;t exist for
this topic in some prime community real estate, and so I created one.
Instantly, I was the leader of a community. Within weeks, people started
pouring in.</p>

<p>The funny thing about being in charge of a community is that it doesn&#39;t
require merit or community-building skills. Being in charge of
a community merely requires that one have authority: The ability to
decide who is part of the community and who is not. Because I founded
the community, I had the authority.</p>

<p>My apparent goal was to build a community. My actions conflicted wildly
with that goal. I built a community that reflected my beliefs, misguided
and deluded as they were. But, I built it, and they did come. I ran my
community as I thought one was supposed to. I treated people as
I thought they were supposed to be treated, as I expected to be treated
in other, similar communities.</p>

<p>The community grew. The channel temperature regularly rose, and rather
than cool it down, I delighted in goading people before removing them.
After all, I needed to be completely sure this was a bad person, one
undeserving of the privilege of being part of this community to justify
my use of authority. So, I would provoke them into unacceptable behavior
and then ban them for it. Disagree with me in a way I don&#39;t like?
Goodbye, and you&#39;re not welcome back. Getting frustrated and coming to
us for help? If you&#39;re being emotional, you&#39;re not like us, so you&#39;re
banned. <em>-- delete this paragraph?</em></p>

<p>I called myself a community leader. Put it on my resume and everything.
I had no leadership skills, but I convinced myself that because people
were still there, because they had not created their own space to be rid
of me, that I was doing things correctly.</p>

<p>Like all authority, I had my delegates. And like me, they were not
picked for skills in leadership. I told myself I picked them because
their contributions were more valuable. I felt that they earned the
privilege to exercise authority. They had merit, and what nobler design
than to be rewarded for one&#39;s merit? But, really, I gave them access to
my authority because I noticed them, because they stood out to me, and
because they were like me.</p>

<p>Eventually, real life got in the way, and I disappeared for a while. My
delegates went on. The community went on. The abuse of power went on.
The machine ground on, exactly as I had built it to. I still held the
keys, so the machine couldn&#39;t fix itself. But, it was made in my image,
so the machine wouldn&#39;t fix itself if it could.</p>

<p>When I came back, I told myself I wasn&#39;t going to be the same asshole
I used to be. That I would try to escape from doing all the
far-too-common &quot;genius asshole&quot; tropes that pervade tech communities and
try to help foster a more welcoming, inclusive community.</p>

<p>But, I kept my trust in my delegates. I felt it wasn&#39;t my place to
second-guess other authorities. After all, didn&#39;t we all have the common
goal of making a better community? Worse, my criteria for the selection
of those delegates was the same. So, despite my personal growth, the
community continued much as it had before.</p>

<p>I rationalized it to myself: These people embued with power had
contributed in major ways to the community, and if I wanted them to keep
contributing, I had to reward them with authority. The ability to remove
people from the community was the reward I gave out for contributing to
the community.</p>

<p>Months and years went by. The abuse continued. The community thrived in
spite of it. That&#39;s the funny thing about topical communities: If you&#39;re
a popular place to get help on a topic, if you&#39;re recommended by books
and bloggers, if you&#39;re in within easy access of hundreds of other,
similar communities, you can get away with quite a lot of toxicity and
vitriol and still have a flowing river of users, though those users may
be of limited variety...</p>

<p>Slowly, I started trying to deal with the problem. As I had feared, the
community lost the contributions of those I deauthorized. It turns out,
though, that their contributions were not worth the trouble they caused.
Toxic members of communities can slowly trickle out poison. Toxic
authority is a factory of venom that attracts more toxic people.</p>

<p>Their extraction was painful, but others were more than willing to fill
in the gaps they left. All they needed was an opportunity in the vaccuum
left by the removal of the bad apples.</p>

<p>Now, the community has a good set of leaders. It continues without the
toxic authority that I had actively created, and then passively enabled.
I can&#39;t honestly say it was an earth-shattering change: The users still
come and go. Though, I hope now with more valuable contributors being
encouraged to help, and more users being encouraged to learn and grow.</p>

<p>I still have the authority. But now I also have the responsibility.
Nobody gave me either of them. I took the authority, and spent a lot of
time learning the responsibility. Nobody could stop me, and nobody could
do it for me.</p>

<p>To have absolute influence over a technical community, I didn&#39;t have to
take a test. I didn&#39;t need to demonstrate leadership skills. I didn&#39;t
even have to actually care about the community as a whole much of the
time. All of which are why volunteer technical communities can be
hostile, unwelcoming places.</p>

            <p>As a data warehouse, a significant part of my job involves log analysis.
Besides the standard root cause analysis, I need to verify database
writes, diagnose user access issues, and look for under-used (and
over-used) data sets. Additionally, my boss needs quarterly and yearly
reports for client billing, and some of our clients need usage reports
to identify data they might be paying for but not using (which we can
then shut off to reduce costs). This has recently become a popular space
for new solutions.</p>

<p>On the other side, as a sysadmin, I need to get other reports like how
all the machine&#39;s resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) are being used,
what processes are running on the machine and how those processes used
resources over time. This is basic monitoring, and there are lots of
solutions here, too. In the true Unix philosophy, there are command-line
programs to query every one of these, which write out text that I can
then parse.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://preaction.me/blog/2015/01/21/managing-sql-data-with-yertl.html">my previous post about
ysql</a>, I showed how
to use the <code>ysql</code> utility to read/write YAML documents to SQL databases.
Now, <a href="http://preaction.me/yertl">Yertl</a> has a <a href="http://preaction.me/yertl/pod/ygrok"><code>ygrok</code>
utility</a> to parse plain text into YAML documents.</p>

<p>For what seems hours, you scan the board. The colors are sharp against the
simple background. Some movement catches your eye, but it doesn&#39;t feel right,
so you ignore it. Time stretches on.</p>

<p>There! The perfect move. Leaving the perfect next move. A quick flick. A match.
The pieces fall into place. Another match. Another. Another. A special piece.
Another special piece. It fires, triggering more. Chaos consumes.</p>

<p>The board is in ruins. Your carefully planned next move is lost in the
destruction. You&#39;re back to scanning the board to try to find where you belong
in this new world.</p>

<p>Is this a game, or is it your development strategy?</p>

<p>Software development is chaos. Either you work to managing chaos, consuming it,
or it works on consuming you. There are too many possibilities, too much input,
to brute-force your way to completion (how much software do you know of that
can be considered complete?).</p>

<p>In the face of these possibilities, a rigid development plan will fail. Vague
goals are better. Goals written in terms of a problem are best. Problems don&#39;t
change, once you find their roots.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know this post was going to be about Agile, but there it is.</p>

<p>Exact is for computers. We are not computers. We are human. We are chaos.</p>

            <p><a href="http://staticsitegenerators.net">Static site generators</a> are popular these
days. For small sites, the ability to quickly author content using simple tools
is key. The ability to use lower-cost (even free) hosting, often without any
dynamic capabilities, is good for trying to maintain a budget. For larger
sites, the ability to serve content quickly and cheaply is beneficial, and
since most pages are read far more often than they are written, generating a
full web page to store on the filesystem can improve performance (and lower
costs).</p>

<p>For me, I like the convenience of using <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>
to host project-oriented websites. The project itself is already on Github, so
why not keep the website closely tied to it so it doesn&#39;t get out-of-date? For
an organization like <a href="http://chicago.pm.org">the Chicago Perl Mongers</a>, Github
can even host custom domains, allowing easy collaboration on websites.</p>

<p>It&#39;s through the Chicago.PM website that I was introduced to Octopress, a
blogging engine built on Jekyll. It&#39;s through using Octopress that I decided to
write my own static site generator,
