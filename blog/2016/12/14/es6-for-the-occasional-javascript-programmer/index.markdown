title: ES6 for the Occasional JavaScript Programmer
---

A [few weeks ago I gave
a talk](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/235316571/) for [the
Chicago Perl Mongers](http://chicago.pm.org) called "ES6 for the
JavaScript Irregular". A lot of developers are only occasional
JavaScript developers, and so may not be fully-informed on all the
latest developments in the JavaScript world. If this is you, you can
[read my notes on ECMAScript 6, the latest specification of JavaScript,
on my
Github](https://github.com/preaction/ES6-For-JS-Irregulars/blob/master/NOTES.md).
