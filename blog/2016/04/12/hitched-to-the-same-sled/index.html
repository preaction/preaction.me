            <section id="section-1">
                <p>There are a lot of differences between working by yourself and working
with a team. To use the standard car analogy: A one-wheeled car is a lot
easier to manage than a 4-wheeled car. With a one-wheeled car, we only
have one wheel to worry about. One wheel handles direction and momentum.
One wheel is less stable, but more agile, being able to simply pivot
in-place. A four-wheeled car is more stable, and different wheels can
handle different concerns, including stability, direction, and momentum.
But there can be problems if one of the wheels starts going in the wrong
direction... Then the vehicle manager has to get out of the car, find
the wheel, ask it why it went the wrong way, and bolt it back in to
place.</p>

<p>Wait... That analogy doesn&#39;t work. Wheels don&#39;t have individual
personalities and goals (besides the notorious vanity of white-walled
tires, which is why nobody hires them anymore). We need a better
analogy...</p>

<p>A one-dog sled is a lot easier to manage than a 4-dog sled. With only
one dog to feed, maintain, pet, brush, praise, scold, and muster, the
manager&#39;s job is a lot less work. One dog can&#39;t get into fights with
itself (except that elusive tail, which it will one day catch, just you
wait). One dog can&#39;t disagree with other dogs about where to go and how
best to get there.</p>

<p>But, one dog can only travel at the speed of one dog, and only for how
long one dog can travel. One dog can&#39;t draw maps and plans on
a whiteboard for the other dogs if there are no other dogs (and no
whiteboard). One dog is not enough for every project.</p>

<p>One four-dog sled may be technically slower than four one-dog sleds put
together, but one four-dog sled is also easier to manage: One manager
for four dogs, one break room, one set of chew toys, one conference
room, one box of imitation-bacon dog treats that they all begged to
have.</p>

<p>But managing a four-dog team is a lot different from managing a one-dog
team. Problems that simply cannot exist in a one-dog team, like
inter-canine communication, grooming and hygiene standards, and best
practices for harnessing and unharnessing, will now be of utmost
importance to the leader of a four-dog team.</p>

<p>Even being a dog in a four-dog team is a lot different from being
a one-dog team. A dog has to learn the communication system, the
strengths and weaknesses of the other dogs, what everyone&#39;s butt smells
like. Over time, the dog will assimilate, and some of the dog&#39;s
knowledge will spread through the team as they grow closer together.</p>

<p>But the biggest difference is that each dog has its own personality, and
not all of those personalities are sociable. Some dogs can be set in
their ways. Some dogs just won&#39;t make the effort to defend their ideas.
Some dogs can be constantly battling for leadership. Some dogs will
always turn to the right when confused, pulling the entire team with
them. Some dogs refuse to follow the harnessing best practices and
occasionally break free and start running too fast, leaving the other
dogs to wait while the rogue is tracked down, re-harnessed, and gently
reminded about the harnessing procedures.</p>

<p>If your sled team has these problems, there are a few things you, as
a sled dog manager, need to do. Overall, you need to be clear and
consistent about your expectations. When problems come up, they need to
be addressed. And every dog on the team needs to be informed, especially
about the other dogs on the team.</p>

<p>The first step is being clear and consistent about expectations. Dogs
can be kind of hard to train. They want to be good dogs, they want those
imitation-bacon dog treats (beg for them, in fact), they just need to
know how. Make your requirements clear. Write them down (er...)
somewhere and make sure to refer to them. When all the dogs are
following the same minimum requirements, everyone can get harnessed and
moving forward more quickly. The secret to meeting goals isn&#39;t going
more fast, it&#39;s going less slow.</p>

<p>When those expectations aren&#39;t reached, it needs to be addressed, in
private, and as soon as possible. The best time to address the problem
is immediately when it happened, but the second-best time is right now.
Tell them how they need to improve, and give them some support in
meeting expectations, either from yourself or another dog on the team.
The entire team is working together, and every opportunity to foster
closer connections should be exploited.</p>

<p>Making sure every dog is fully informed about the team also helps foster
closer connections. Every dog is unique, with strengths and weaknesses,
and without that knowledge, the individual dogs can make bad decisions
for the team. If one dog decides to go left, while another goes right,
the sled is in for a bumpy ride. When two dogs meet for the first time,
there could be communication differences, which could lead to conflict.
Early conflict is much harder to overcome, so any information that can
smooth the transition is valuable.</p>

<p>For better or for worse, people aren&#39;t dogs. But we have a lot of the
same problems (except we get real bacon, and we don&#39;t have to beg for
it). But, like our furry companions, when we&#39;re working as a team, we
need clear leadership, consistent expectations, and complete
information. With this framework in place, the team can easily address
the common, minor issues that are the nature of teamwork.</p>
