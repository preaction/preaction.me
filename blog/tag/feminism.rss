                <p>I said <a href="https://twitter.com/preaction/status/923937942388822017">&quot;I believe men can be better&quot; last week regarding a job ad I was
reading</a>, and I&#39;ve
been thinking that this is a thing I&#39;ve rarely heard from anyone. I hear, all
the time, aphorisms disparaging men and removing all agency and blame for bad
behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Boys will be boys&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;That&#39;s just how guys are&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You should have known that would happen -- he&#39;s a guy&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Growing up, I expected to be a terrible person. I expected to be
uncontrollable. I expected to want to hurt people. And I didn&#39;t want to be that
person. When I didn&#39;t become that person, I still knew that was what people
expected of me.</p>

<p>So, through the power of stereotype threat, a shy, sensitive boy turns into a
sullen, introverted man who struggles with depression. Because nobody ever told
him that men could be better.</p>

<p>And, through the magic of stereotype excuses, sexual predators occupy our
highest offices and control our most powerful institutions. Because nobody ever
told them that men had to be better.</p>

<p>I was linked to this article after a discussion that was triggered by
a Tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/852265380156510214">https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/852265380156510214</a></p>

<p>In this article, the author describes a group called &quot;weird nerds&quot;,
later renamed &quot;hackers&quot;, and goes through some of the reasons why this
group is rejecting new members of their community (namely &quot;brogrammers&quot;
and &quot;geek feminists&quot;, a false equivalence if ever there was one).</p>

<p>As someone who fits the author&#39;s idea of a hacker (the classical
definition of hacker, not someone who breaks into computers), and yet
has never felt like part of the hacker community, there are a lot of
things in here that are bad, but I&#39;ll comment for now on a couple
quotes:</p>
