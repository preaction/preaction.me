<p>I was linked to this article after a discussion that was triggered by
a Tweet: <a href="https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/852265380156510214">https://twitter.com/shadowcat_mst/status/852265380156510214</a></p>

<p>In this article, the author describes a group called &quot;weird nerds&quot;,
later renamed &quot;hackers&quot;, and goes through some of the reasons why this
group is rejecting new members of their community (namely &quot;brogrammers&quot;
and &quot;geek feminists&quot;, a false equivalence if ever there was one).</p>

<p>As someone who fits the author&#39;s idea of a hacker (the classical
definition of hacker, not someone who breaks into computers), and yet
has never felt like part of the hacker community, there are a lot of
things in here that are bad, but I&#39;ll comment for now on a couple
quotes:</p>

        <title>A Community is a Reflection of its Leaders</title>

            <p>I&#39;ve been in charge of <a href="http://preaction.me/blog/2016/02/15/a-community-is-a-reflection-of-its-leaders/#footnote-1">a certain community</a> for a very
long time. Before my actual tech career started, even. Back when doing
websites was just a hobby I didn&#39;t want to ruin by getting money
involved.</p>

<p>I was put in charge of this community after only a few hours of effort:
I wanted to learn something, I saw that a community didn&#39;t exist for
this topic in some prime community real estate, and so I created one.
Instantly, I was the leader of a community. Within weeks, people started
pouring in.</p>

<p>The funny thing about being in charge of a community is that it doesn&#39;t
require merit or community-building skills. Being in charge of
a community merely requires that one have authority: The ability to
decide who is part of the community and who is not. Because I founded
the community, I had the authority.</p>
