            <p>I&#39;ve been in charge of <a href="http://preaction.me/blog/2016/02/15/a-community-is-a-reflection-of-its-leaders/#footnote-1">a certain community</a> for a very
long time. Before my actual tech career started, even. Back when doing
websites was just a hobby I didn&#39;t want to ruin by getting money
involved.</p>

<p>I was put in charge of this community after only a few hours of effort:
I wanted to learn something, I saw that a community didn&#39;t exist for
this topic in some prime community real estate, and so I created one.
Instantly, I was the leader of a community. Within weeks, people started
pouring in.</p>

<p>The funny thing about being in charge of a community is that it doesn&#39;t
require merit or community-building skills. Being in charge of
a community merely requires that one have authority: The ability to
decide who is part of the community and who is not. Because I founded
the community, I had the authority.</p>
