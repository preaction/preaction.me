                <p>A time series database is a massively useful tool for system reporting
and monitoring. By storing series of simple values attached to
timestamps, an ops team can see how fast their application is
processing data, how much traffic they&#39;re serving, and how many
resources they&#39;re consuming. From this data they can determine how well
their application is working, track down issues in the system, and plan
for future resource needs.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of new databases and tools developed to create,
store, and consume time series data, and existing databases are being
enhanced to better support time series data.</p>

<p>With the new release of <a href="http://preaction.me/yertl">ETL::Yertl</a>, we can
easily translate SQL database queries into metrics for monitoring and
reporting. I&#39;ve been using these new features to monitor the <a href="http://cpantesters.org">CPAN
Testers</a> application.</p>
