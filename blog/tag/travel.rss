                <p>For this year&#39;s <a href="http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2016/">Perl QA Hackathon</a>, I
travelled to the UK for the first time. I don&#39;t know what I was expecting, but
what I got was kind of surreal. I&#39;ve watched a lot of British television and
movies. But experiencing it was a lot different.</p>

<p>I knew things would be different. But the interesting thing was how subtle the
differences are. Everything&#39;s closer together, but the effect is warm and cozy
not oppressive (despite the weather). The roads are a lot different. I can see
why some modern subdivisions are eschewing a grid of streets with a curvy,
winding road system (though the effect in the US is anti-pedestrian).</p>

<p>Asda was very familiar though. Freakishly familiar. Finding out that it was
owned by WalMart makes absolute sense. The interior of <a href="https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/warwickshire/the-lawrence-sheriff-rugby">The Lawrence Sheriff
pub</a>
was familiar as well, but because it&#39;s a JD Wetherspoon, which is a franchise
(picture the interior of pubs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Flavours_Cornetto_trilogy">the Cornetto
trilogy</a>).</p>

<p>When I got back, all I could think about is how loud Chicago is. And how
organized. Efficient (that&#39;s not a compliment). A lot of the difference between
the two boils down to &quot;big city&quot; vs &quot;small city&quot;. Rugby has 70,000 people, and
another city I&#39;ve lived, Oskhosh, WI has 70,000 people, and the differences are
still severe. Records of the village of Rugby go back to 1000AD. The hotel I
was staying at pre-dated the entire city of Chicago (by perhaps 100 years). The
hotel probably pre-dated the United States. It&#39;s difficult to fathom.</p>

<p>And now, watching UK TV as I often do, I find myself recognizing the styles.
There&#39;s now a very obvious difference in my head between &quot;generic human
dwelling&quot; and &quot;English house&quot;, and between &quot;generic human village&quot; and &quot;English
village&quot;.</p>

<p>All in all, I really enjoyed the trip. Next up: Germany. I hear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_II_of_Bavaria">a mad
king</a> created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">some
interesting
architecture</a>...</p>
