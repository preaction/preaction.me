<h2>Talks</h2>

<h3><a href="talks/chicago-pm-2018">Working Remotely With SSH (Chicago.PM 2018)</a></h3>

<p>This talk introduces SSH to anyone who isn&#39;t familiar and demonstrates
the basic use-cases of logging in, generating and using SSH keys,
transferring files over SSH, and running the SSH agent.</p>

<p>There is also some discussion of the SSH config file, how SSH agent
forwarding works (and why to use it), and how to set up SSH tunnels (and
why).</p>

<p>This is a good exploration of the basics of SSH needed to get useful
work done, and an introduction to some of the more useful advanced SSH
features.</p>

<h4>Presenter&#39;s Notes</h4>

<p>This talk went well and lasted about an hour. The section explaining
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography was extraneous and irrelevant and
resulted in a lengthy digression. I don&#39;t know enough about them to
explain them, and that&#39;s often seen as an invitation for someone else to
do so (despite it being very clearly not relevant). This part should be
removed from future talks.</p>

<p>Errata: The <code>ssh-copy-id</code> is not part of the OpenSSH distribution, and
is a shell script that Linux and MacOS include for ease-of-use.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">tmux - Terminal Multiplexer</a></h3>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki">Tmux</a> on a system you&#39;ve
logged in to with SSH allows you to run programs without worrying about
your programs being stopped if you get disconnected. The programs you
run inside a Tmux session will remain running, and you can re-connect to
the server and re-attach to your Tmux session.</p>

<p>Often my first step after logging in to a machine is running a Tmux
session just in case.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen - Terminal Window Manager</a></h3>

<p>Much like Tmux, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> lets you
run programs, disconnect from the server, and then reconnect later to
continue your work.</p>

<h3><a href="https://rsync.samba.org">rsync - Advanced file transfer</a></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a> command uses SSH (and other
protocols) to synchronize files between servers. This is a more powerful
tool than <code>scp</code> for tasks like mirroring data and backups.</p>
