Okay, so SSH is telling us that it&#39;s not going to ask us again,
but SSH will also refuse to let us connect to any other machine.
If we try to connect to <code>stage.cpantesters.org</code> and
it doesn&#39;t have the right identity key, we&#39;ll get this message
instead:

This doesn&#39;t look happy, but it shows what happens if perhaps
stage.cpantesters.org moves to a new server with a new identity
(which is the most likely scenario), or if someone is trying to
hijack your connection (not likely, but not impossible).
This is part of the &quot;Secure&quot; in Secure Shell.
To get rid of this message, once we&#39;ve verified that nobody is
trying to mislead us, we need to edit our &quot;known hosts&quot; file,
which for me is &quot;/Users/doug/.ssh/known_hosts&quot;, and remove the
old entry for &quot;stage.cpantesters.org&quot;. Then we&#39;ll be asked again

To remember these things, we can write an SSH config file. On Linux and
MacOS, this will be a file called &quot;config&quot; in the &quot;.ssh&quot; directory in
our user directory (you may have to create this directory). For Windows,
this will be a file called &quot;ssh_config&quot; in our user directory.

define a host that doesn&#39;t really exist. Like, &quot;Host ct-stage&quot;. Then, we

<h1>Identification</h1>
<aside class="notes">
Passwords identify us. They &quot;authenticate&quot; us. By knowing the password,
I prove I am who I claim to be: &quot;dbell&quot;. If someone learned my password,
they could claim to be me. That&#39;s not ideal, which is why much
discussion and research goes in to what makes a good password. We&#39;re not
going to talk about that, because most popular knowledge is outdated and
I could spend hours discussing why.

others will validate that you are who you say you are. It has three
parts: ssh-ed25519 is the key type, this base-64 encoded string is the
public key, and the last part is a comment identifying the key. Notice
that by default it has my username and my computer&#39;s host name. We can
use this to keep track of our keys on multiple computers, since each of

<h1>Copy Public Key</h1>
<h2><code>ssh-copy-id</code></h2>

Wait. I thought we were getting rid of passwords... Well, if we type the

days.

<!-- SSH Agent -->
<section>

<section>
<h1>SSH Agent</h1>
<h2><code>ssh-agent</code></h2>
<aside class="notes">
OpenSSH comes with a program to safely hold on to our keys: ssh-agent.
The agent is a program that runs in the background. We then add our keys
to it, typing our key passphrases. Then, whenever a new ssh connection
needs a key, it asks the agent instead.
</aside></section>

<section>
<pre class="terminal"><span class="prompt">$ </span><kbd>eval $(ssh-agent)</kbd>
Agent pid 9653
</pre>
<aside class="notes">
We run the SSH agent using <code>eval $(ssh-agent)</code>. That&#39;s kind
of weird, so what&#39;s that doing?
</aside></section>

<section>
<pre class="terminal"><span class="prompt">$ </span><kbd>ssh-agent</kbd>

</pre>
<aside class="notes">
This is the shell code that is being run. The SSH agent creates two
environment variables, SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID. This is what SSH
will use to communicate with the agent when needed.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Add Identities (Keys)</h1>
<h2><code>ssh-add</code></h2>

Now we aren&#39;t prompted for our key&#39;s passphrase when we log in. We won&#39;t have
to type in our passphrase again until the SSH agent dies.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Start SSH Agent at Boot</h1>
<aside class="notes">
To make sure that we only have to type our passphrase once when our
computer reboots, we can configure our system to start the SSH agent at
boot. This is dependent on your OS, but most Unix-like desktops have an
SSH agent already running.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Automatically Add Keys</h1>
<h2><code>AddKeysToAgent yes</code></h2>
<aside class="notes">
If we don&#39;t want to explicitly call <code>ssh-add</code>, we can add
<code>AddKeysToAgent yes</code> in our ssh config file. Then, provided
there is a running agent, our keys will automatically be added as they
are used.  I prefer doing this, as it reduces the things I have to
remember to do.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Use MacOS Keychain</h1>
<h2><code>UseKeychain yes</code></h2>
<h2><code>ssh-add -K</code></h2>
<aside class="notes">
Finally, if you&#39;re on Mac OS X, you can add <code>UseKeychain yes</code>
to your SSH config to look up your passphrase securely from your OS
keychain.  If you do this, you just need to add your passphrase to your
OS keychain (<code>ssh-add -K</code>) and you&#39;ll never have to type it
again!

<aside class="notes">Uh-oh. Github doesn&#39;t know who we are. Probably
because our key is on our local machine, not the SSH server. We could

agent forwarding is not enabled by default.</aside>

<!-- SCP -->
<section>

<section>
<h1>Transfer Files</h1>
<aside class="notes">In the course of our development, we&#39;re likely
going to need to transfer files. Luckily for us, SSH has a way to do
this.</aside>
</section>

<section>
<h1>SCP - Secure Copy</h1>
<h2>scp</h2>
<aside class="notes">
SCP is the tool SSH provides for this. SCP allows us to move files
between machines. For an example, let&#39;s download the README file from
our Git repository.
</aside></section>

<section>
<pre class="terminal">$ scp stage.cpantesters.org:www/README.mkdn ./
<span class="fragment">README.mkdn        100% 1743    49.1KB/s   00:00</span></pre>
<aside class="notes">
To download a file, we specify the host we want to download from,
followed by a colon, followed by the path we want to download. This is
relative to our &quot;home&quot; directory, so we don&#39;t need to specify a complete
path. Then we specify where we want to copy it to locally. SCP copies
it, and provides us a running status while it does.
</aside></section>

<section>
<pre class="terminal">$ scp ./README.mkdn stage.cpantesters.org:www/
<span class="fragment">README.mkdn        100% 1712    13.5KB/s   00:00</span></pre>
<aside class="notes">
To upload a file, we reverse the arguments. Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t
ever gotten SCP to work copying from one remote machine to another
remote machine, though the docs seem to imply that it would work.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Recursively</h1>
<h2><code>scp -r</code></h2>
<aside class="notes">
Like the regular copy command, you can copy things recursively. Unlike
the regular &quot;cp&quot; command, this command uses lower-case r instead of
upper-case R. Enjoy the confusion as you use both all the time.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Rsync</h1>
<h2>For extreme use</h2>
<aside class="notes">
If you find yourself using SCP often, or find yourself scripting with
SCP, you might want to take a look at Rsync, which has a lot more
options including scanning the source/destination to ensure it doesn&#39;t
transfer files that are the same in both. I could write an entire talk
on Rsync, it has that many useful features.
</aside></section>

</section>
<!-- SSH Tunnels -->
<section>

<section>
<h1>Networking</h1>
<aside class="notes">
In addition to transferring files, we might also end up needing to
transfer network connections.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Firewall</h1>
<h1>Internal Network</h1>
<aside class="notes">
If our remote server is behind a firewall, which is probably should be,
we might try to run our code but be unable to connect to it over the
Internet.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>SSH Tunnel</h1>
<aside class="notes">
To traverse the firewall or gain access to the internal network, we can
open up an SSH tunnel, and use our SSH connection to connect to our
code.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1><code>ssh stage.cpantesters.org</code></h1>
<h1><code>-L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000</code></h1>
<aside class="notes">
To open up a tunnel, we use the -L flag to ssh when we connect to open
a local port that will connect to someplace as though I was making the
connection from the remote host. So, in this case if we connect locally to port 3000, SSH will forward our connection
through our SSH connection and from there connect to &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; port
3000. So, this acts like we&#39;re on the remote machine and connecting to a
local service, but instead I&#39;m here on my laptop.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>Localhost</h1>
<h1>Internal Hosts</h1>
<h1>External Hosts</h1>
<aside class="notes">
We don&#39;t just have to connect to localhost, we can do this with any
address.  We can connect to any internal server, the DNS lookup will be
performed by the remote host. This is good for if the server is part of
a VPN.  We could also even try connecting to Amazon or Google. But
remember that this is just forwarding the connection, it isn&#39;t fixing
the HTTP (so, it probably won&#39;t work the way you might want).
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1>SOCKS Proxy</h1>
<h2><code>ssh stage.cpantesters.org -D 3000</code></h2>
<aside class="notes">
To actually navigate any website through the SSH tunnel, you can set up
a SOCKS proxy using the -D flag and then configure your browser to use
your SSH connection as a proxy, but that&#39;s more advanced than we have
time for here.
</aside></section>

<section>
<h1><code>ssh stage.cpantesters.org</code></h1>
<h1><code>-R 3000:127.0.0.1:3000</code></h1>
<aside class="notes">
We can also do this in reverse to invite the remote server to use our
local machine to make connections to 127.0.0.1 port 3000.  I&#39;ve never
done this, but it might be used to show off code running on your laptop
to someone on the server (perhaps they&#39;ve used -L to set up their own
tunnel to see your code).
