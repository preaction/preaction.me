# Git - Version Control

## Talks

### [DevTogether 2019 Git Workshop](talks/devtogether-2019)

This is a beginner's introduction to Git and version control systems in
general. This is about 1-2 hours worth of content, but I'll probably end
up expanding it into a full half-day / day-long tutorial over time.

## External Resources

* [Official Documentation Site](https://git-scm.com/doc) - Includes the
  free book 'Pro Git' and several videos. Especially see [the Git
  website's external links](https://git-scm.com/doc/ext) for good
  information.
* [Git From The Bottom
  Up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/) - If you've
  got the basics of Git down, here's a good read to learn about how Git
  works internally.
