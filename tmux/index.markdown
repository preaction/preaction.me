### [Organized Development with Tmux](talk)

Tmux is a terminal multiplexer which allows you to open multiple shells
in a single terminal, split your terminal window into panes, and detach
from your terminal to resume your work later! Using Tmux can help keep
track of all the tasks currently being worked on and quickly switch
between tasks to pick up right where you left off!
