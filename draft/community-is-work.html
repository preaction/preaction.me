            <p>The worst thing about open-source communities is that they are mostly
comprised of volunteers. Not only does this mean that people must
self-select and the community must prune its ranks of toxic elements,
but it means that the people involved in the community are there because
they want to be there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, people being who they are, it can be extremely easy to
make someone not want to be there anymore... So far, the greater
open-source community has mostly gotten along by saying those people
don&#39;t deserve to be there. The more common response to vitriol is not
telling the source that &quot;you need to stop spewing poison&quot; but telling
the destination &quot;you need to stop being hurt by poison&quot;.</p>

<p>It takes effort to participate in an open-source community. For that
reason, we should be doing everything we can to ensure that effort is
valued and continues.</p>

<p>Dealing with toxic people in a community is work. Hard work. Work that
must be done to participate in the community. At some point, being part
of the community becomes no longer worth dealing with its toxic
elements. And at that point, there is no other thing to do but leave.</p>
