            <p>Since I had the authority, I could make rules that reflected the
community I wanted to build. So, I saw fit to make only one rule: Thou
shalt not piss me off (or, more diplomatically, &quot;Don&#39;t do something
someone with authority doesn&#39;t like&quot;). With a straight face, I called my
one rule &quot;an experiment&quot;, and would point out that, technically, this
was also the only rule in the outside world as well. I thought I was
doing a favor, because after all, I could write all the rules I wanted,
and use my authority to ignore them when it suited me. By having only
one rule, everything was honest, and nobody could argue over the rules.
It took me a long time to understand that my one simple rule wasn&#39;t
simple, fair, or just.</p>

<p>In September 2014 we finally adopted formal rules. The rules are simple,
and include examples of proscribed behavior. Now, instead of escalating,
I can simply say &quot;please stop that, it&#39;s against the rules.&quot; Their
reaction to that line will determine whether the issue is dropped
(sometimes), or it results in removal (more often than I&#39;d like).</p>
